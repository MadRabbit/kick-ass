# KickAss

This is a simple benchmarking tool for regressive testing of the lovely.io [dom package](/packages/dom) and certainly for showing off

## How To Run

Assuming you're a pissed off jQuery bot, here's how you can make it run by yourself.

```
npm install lovely -g
lovely bootstrap
lovely install dom-1.4.2 ui-2.1.2
lovely server
```

Then go to the browser `http://localhost:3000` and click the `Start` button. Then start moaning that I cheated, try to patch the jQuery test, make a screenshot and shovel it up in your rear.

Sorry, i just got carried away, been there so many times... Anyhow, don't be an a-hole, this test is the most sane one out there, it wasn't built to make you upset, it was built to make lovely.io better. The fact that jQuery sucks miserably in it, doesn't have anything to do with the test. jQuery was added there just for kicks.
